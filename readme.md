## Setup

Create the `.env` file using the `cp .env.example .env` command. Update it, if you want/need to.

Since this project was created using `bun init` in [Bun](https://bun.com) v1.3.2, `bun` related commands are used:

- Use `bun install` to install the project dependencies.
- Use `bun dev` (or use `./dev.sh` provided script) to start a development server.
- Use `bun start` to run for production.
- Use `bun run prettier` to format the code using Prettier.
